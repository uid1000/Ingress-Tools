# Plugin: Checkpoint Countdown

[checkpoint-countdown.user.js](https://github.com/uid1000/Ingress-Tools/raw/main/checkpoint-countdown.user.js)

[Requires IITC] Fork of the stock IITC _"Scoring cycle / checkpoint times"_ plugin by jonatkins. Removes the previous checkpoint and cycle start rows, adds a countdown timer, and adds additional highlights at 1 hour and 15 minutes before checkpoint.
